# Monitoring and Scaling S4

This guide provides information on monitoring and scaling the S4 Semantic Search Service for optimal performance in production environments.

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **API Usage**
   - Request rate and volume
   - Response times
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Rate limiting triggers

2. **Storage Metrics**
   - S3 bucket usage by tenant
   - Document count by tenant
   - Average document size
   - Upload/download rates

3. **Search Performance**
   - Query latency
   - Vector index size
   - Cache hit rates
   - Embedding generation time

4. **System Resources**
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Network throughput
   - Disk I/O (for temporary storage)

### Monitoring Tools

#### AWS CloudWatch (for AWS deployments)

Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for:
- ECS/EC2 instance metrics
- S3 bucket metrics
- Load balancer metrics
- Lambda function performance (if using serverless components)

Example CloudWatch alarm for high CPU usage:
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name s4-high-cpu \
  --alarm-description "Alarm when CPU exceeds 70%" \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 70 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-12345678 \
  --evaluation-periods 2 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:s4-alerts
```

#### Prometheus and Grafana (for self-hosted)

For self-hosted deployments, use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization:

1. Install Prometheus and configure it to scrape the S4 API endpoints
2. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize:
   - System metrics
   - API performance
   - Tenant usage

Example Prometheus configuration:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 's4'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['s4-api:8000']
```

### Log Management

Configure central log collection using:
- AWS CloudWatch Logs
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Graylog

Ensure logs include:
- Request IDs for tracing
- Tenant IDs for isolation
- Performance timings
- Error details with stack traces

## Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

S4 is designed to scale horizontally for increased load:

1. **API Layer**
   - Add more API containers/instances
   - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic
   - Configure auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics

2. **Worker Layer**
   - Scale document processing workers independently
   - Use a queue (like SQS) for processing tasks
   - Configure worker auto-scaling based on queue depth

### Vertical Scaling

For specific components that need more resources:

1. **Vector Database**
   - Use larger instance types for FAISS/vector search
   - Increase memory for better caching
   - Consider using SSD storage for indices

2. **API Servers**
   - Increase CPU for higher concurrency
   - Increase memory for caching

### Database Scaling

For the tenant/metadata database:

1. **Read Replicas**
   - Add read replicas for query-heavy workloads
   - Direct read-only operations to replicas

2. **Sharding**
   - For very large deployments, consider sharding by tenant ID
   - Implement a router to direct queries to the right shard

### S3 Performance

Optimize S3 for large-scale document storage:

1. **Request Rate**
   - Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads
   - Implement multipart uploads for large documents

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Configure lifecycle policies for infrequently accessed documents
   - Consider S3 Intelligent-Tiering for optimal storage costs

## High Availability

Ensure high availability with:

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**
   - Deploy across multiple availability zones
   - Configure proper failover mechanisms

2. **Redundancy**
   - Use redundant load balancers
   - Deploy multiple API instances
   - Set up database replication

3. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Regular backups of tenant data and configurations
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Test failover scenarios regularly

## Performance Tuning

### API Performance

1. **Caching**
   - Implement Redis for API response caching
   - Cache common search queries
   - Cache user authentication tokens

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configure per-tenant rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

### Search Performance

1. **Index Optimization**
   - Tune FAISS parameters for your workload
   - Consider index partitioning for large collections

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Implement query result caching
   - Use appropriate batch sizes for vector operations

## Cost Optimization

1. **Right-sizing**
   - Monitor resource usage and adjust instance sizes
   - Scale down during off-peak hours

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Implement document compression
   - Use appropriate S3 storage tiers

3. **API Usage**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Batch operations where possible

## Health Checks and Alerts

1. **Health Endpoints**
   - `/health` for basic service status
   - `/health/detailed` for component-level status

2. **Alert Configuration**
   - Set up alerts for error rate spikes
   - Configure notifications for resource threshold breaches
   - Monitor tenant quota usage and send proactive alerts

Remember to test your scaling configurations in a staging environment before applying to production, and gradually increase load to validate your scaling policies.
