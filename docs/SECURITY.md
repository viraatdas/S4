## API Key Security

S4 uses API keys for authentication. Protect these keys carefully:

### Admin API Key

- **Never** share your Admin API key
- Store the Admin API key in a secure credential manager
- Rotate the Admin API key periodically (at least every 90 days)
- Use a strong, randomly generated key (S4 generates these by default)
- Set up alerts for unusual Admin API key usage

### Tenant API Keys

- Generate unique API keys for each tenant
- Instruct tenants to store their API keys securely
- Implement key rotation capabilities for tenants
- Automatically expire unused tenant API keys
- Limit tenant API key permissions based on their subscription plan

### Environment Variables

- Store API keys and other secrets as environment variables
- **Never** commit API keys to source control
- Use a `.env` file for local development, but ensure it's in `.gitignore`
- For production, use a secure secrets management service:
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - HashiCorp Vault
  - Azure Key Vault
  - GCP Secret Manager

## Access Control

Implement proper access controls to protect your S4 deployment:

### Admin Access

- Limit Admin Portal access to trusted IPs
- Implement multi-factor authentication for Admin Portal access
- Create separate admin accounts with different permission levels
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Log all administrative actions

### Tenant Access

- Enforce strong authentication for tenants
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Set up proper CORS rules to protect against cross-site attacks
- Validate all tenant input
- Isolate tenant resources

## Network Security

Protect your S4 deployment at the network level:

### HTTPS

- **Always** use HTTPS in production
- Configure TLS properly (minimum TLS 1.2)
- Use strong cipher suites
- Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Obtain certificates from a trusted CA

### Firewalls and VPCs

- Deploy within a private VPC
- Use security groups to restrict traffic
- Allow only necessary ports and protocols
- Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) for additional protection
- Consider using a VPN for admin access

### Load Balancers

- Configure load balancers to terminate SSL
- Implement health checks
- Set up proper timeout values
- Configure access logs

## Data Protection

Protect the data stored and processed by S4:

### Storage Security

- Enable encryption at rest for S3 buckets
- Set proper bucket policies
- Disable public access
- Enable versioning to prevent accidental deletion
- Implement lifecycle policies

### Encryption

- Use strong encryption for all sensitive data
- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypt data at rest
- Manage encryption keys securely
- Rotate encryption keys periodically

### Data Retention

- Implement data retention policies
- Automatically purge old or unused data
- Provide data export capabilities for tenants
- Ensure proper data deletion when tenants are removed

## Infrastructure Security

Secure the infrastructure hosting your S4 deployment:

### Container Security

- Use official base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Run containers with minimal privileges
- Keep containers up to date
- Implement resource limits

### Host Security

- Use hardened operating systems
- Apply security patches promptly
- Implement host-based firewalls
- Use antivirus/anti-malware software
- Implement host intrusion detection

### Database Security

- Use strong authentication
- Implement network isolation
- Enable encryption
- Apply security patches
- Regular backups

## Monitoring and Auditing

Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect and respond to security issues:

### Logging

- Centralize logs (CloudWatch, ELK Stack, etc.)
- Log all sensitive operations
- Include necessary context in logs
- Protect logs from tampering
- Set appropriate log retention periods

### Auditing

- Track all administrative actions
- Audit API key usage
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Generate regular audit reports
- Review logs for security anomalies

### Alerting

- Set up alerts for security events
- Monitor for unusual API usage
- Alert on authentication failures
- Track resource utilization spikes
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

## Updates and Patches

Keep your S4 deployment secure with regular updates:

### S4 Updates

- Subscribe to the S4 release notifications
- Test updates in a staging environment
- Plan regular update windows
- Maintain a rollback plan
- Document all changes

### Dependency Updates

- Regularly check for dependency updates
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies in a controlled manner
- Test thoroughly after updates
- Maintain dependency inventory

### Operating System Updates

- Apply security patches promptly
- Use automated patch management
- Test patches before applying to production
- Maintain backup images
- Document patching process

## Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying S4 in production:

### Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Strong Admin API key configured
- [ ] HTTPS properly configured
- [ ] Unnecessary services disabled
- [ ] Firewall rules reviewed and tested
- [ ] Security groups properly configured
- [ ] S3 bucket policies reviewed
- [ ] Database security configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled
- [ ] Backup and restore tested
- [ ] Resource limits configured
- [ ] Network isolation implemented
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Internal security review completed

### Security Testing

- Perform regular penetration testing
- Conduct vulnerability assessments
- Implement automated security scanning
- Review configurations for security issues
- Perform disaster recovery testing

## Security Incident Response

Have a plan ready for security incidents:

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Preparation**: Maintain an incident response plan
2. **Identification**: Quickly identify security incidents
3. **Containment**: Limit the impact of the incident
4. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security based on incidents

### Security Contacts

- Maintain a list of security contacts
- Define escalation procedures
- Establish communication channels
- Set up an incident war room
- Document all steps taken during incidents

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in S4:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly
2. Email us at security@your-org.com with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. If possible, provide a suggested fix
5. We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
6. We aim to address critical issues within 72 hours

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of security issues.
